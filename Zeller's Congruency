/* Zeller’s congruence is an algorithm devised by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week for any Julian or Gregorian calendar date. 
It can be considered to be based on the conversion between Julian day and the calendar date.
It is an algorithm to find the day of the week for any date.
For the Gregorian calender it is:
h=\left ( q + [ \frac{13(m+1)}{5}  ]+K +\left [ \frac{K}{4}\right ]+\left [ \frac{J}{4}\right ]-2J\right )mod7
For the julian calender it is:
h=\left ( q + \left [ \frac{13(m+1)}{5} \right ]+K +\left [ \frac{K}{4}\right ]+5-J\right )mod7

where,
h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, …, 6 = Friday)
q is the day of the month
m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, 5 = May, …, 14 = February)
K the year of the century ( year % 100).
J is the zero-based century (actually ⌊ year/100 ⌋ ) For example, 
the zero-based centuries for 1995 and 2000 are 19 and 20 respectively (to not be confused 
with the common ordinal century enumeration which indicates 20th for both cases). */
